Reversible Processor design using KMD Gates with inherent memory


This work focuses on the development of a Novel Digital Processor with memory using parity preserving reversible logic gates and Quantum cellular automaton (QCA). The design and realization of the integral components of the Digital Processor has been done with reversible KMD Gates. The processor main modules include Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), multipliers, floating point division unit, control and the memory unit. It has a control unit to monitor and control the operation of the processor. QCA design of individual modules of the developed processor is carried out with appropriate multilayer wire crossing. The performance of the individual models of the processor are compared and analyzed with the existing designs. The reversible processor has 891 quantum cost, 141 constant inputs, 188 garbage outputs, it needs 120 number of reversible gates and the total cost is 1397. The results showcase that the developed processor modules are better than the existing modules, also the appropriate usage of reversible logic gates for modern day high performance, economic and low power consumption processors.
